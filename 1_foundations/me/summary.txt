I'm a passionate AI/ML engineer with a deep commitment to pushing the boundaries of artificial intelligence. With over 2 years of experience as a data analyst and AI researcher, I specialize in building production-ready ML systems that solve real-world problems.

My expertise lies in the intersection of deep learning research and practical implementation. My work spans from developing pose estimation systems for autonomous vehicles to creating multilingual RAG pipelines and domain-specific datasets.

When I'm not training neural networks, you'll find me exploring the latest research in areas like Computer Vision, Large Language Models, and Agentic AI.
